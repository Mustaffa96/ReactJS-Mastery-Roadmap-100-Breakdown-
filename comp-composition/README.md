Alright, let’s break down ReactJS Component Composition and Reusability in a way that feels like we’re chatting in a kampung (village) setting, using simple, relatable terms. Imagine we’re sitting under a big tree, sipping teh tarik, and I’m explaining this like I’m telling a story about building a village.

# What is Component Composition?

Think of a kampung house. To build a house, you don’t carve everything from one giant piece of wood, right? Instead, you use different parts: wooden planks for walls, zinc sheets for the roof, windows, doors, and maybe a nice porch. Each part has its own job, but when you put them together, they form a complete house. That’s component composition in ReactJS.

In React, a **component** is like one of those house parts—say, a window or a door. It’s a small, self-contained piece of your app (like a button, a form, or a header). Composition is when you combine these components to build a bigger, complete thing, like a webpage (your "house").

For example:
* A **Button** component is like a door handle—small and does one job (you click it).
* A **Form** component is like a whole door—it might use the Button component (the handle) inside it.
* A **Page** component is like the full house—it might use the Form, a Header, and a Footer component together.
So, composition is about stacking or nesting components like how you assemble parts to build a kampung house.

# What is Reusability?
Now, imagine you’re building not just one house but a whole kampung. You don’t want to carve a new door handle or window frame from scratch for every house, right? That’s a lot of work! Instead, you make one good door handle mold and reuse it for every house. This is reusability in React.

In React, reusability means you write a component once, and then use it in many places across your app. A well-made component is like a reusable mold—it’s flexible enough to fit different situations but solid enough to do its job every time.

For example:
* You create a **Button** component that can take different text or colors. You can use it for a “Submit” button in a login form, a “Buy Now” button in a shop, or a “Like” button in a post.
* Instead of making three different buttons from scratch, you reuse the same Button component and just change its props (like changing the text or color on the button, just like painting the same door handle a different color for each house).

# How Do They Work Together?
In the kampung, you build a house by combining parts (composition), and you save time by reusing good parts across many houses (reusability). In React, you do the same to build your app.

Let’s say you’re building a kampung website:
* You make a **Navbar** component (like the roof of your house—it’s always at the top).
* You make a **Card** component to show info about villagers, like a noticeboard. This Card can be reused to show different info (one for a villager profile, another for a community event).
* You make a **Button** component that’s reused inside the Navbar (for a “Home” link) and inside the Card (for a “Read More” link).
* Finally, you put them all together in a **HomePage** component, like assembling a house:
  * Navbar at the top.
  * A few Cards in the middle to show village news.
  * Buttons scattered around for actions.
This is **composition** (stacking components together) and **reusability** (using the same Button or Card in different places).

# Why is This Awesome?
* **Saves Time:** Like reusing a mold for door handles, reusable components mean you write less code and build faster.
* **Easy to Fix:** If your Button component has a bug, you fix it once, and every button in your app gets fixed (like replacing a faulty handle mold).
* **Keeps Things Tidy:** Composition keeps your code organized, like how a kampung house has clear parts (walls, roof, etc.), so it’s easier to understand and maintain.
* **Flexible:** Reusable components can adapt to different needs with props, like how you can paint a door red for one house and blue for another.

# A Simple Code Example (in Kampung Style)
Imagine we’re writing code to describe our kampung website:
```jsx
// Button component (like a reusable door handle)
function Button(props) {
  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: props.color }}>{props.text}</button>;
}

// Card component (like a noticeboard, reusable for different info)
function Card(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h3>{props.title}</h3>
      <p>{props.description}</p>
      <Button text="Read More" color="blue" /> {/* Reuse Button here */}
    </div>
  );
}

// HomePage component (like the full house)
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navbar /> {/* Like the roof */}
      <Card
        title="Village Meeting"
        description="Come discuss the new well!"
      /> {/* Reuse Card */}
      <Card
        title="Pak Ali's Profile"
        description="Meet our village head."
      /> {/* Reuse Card again */}
      <Button text="Contact Us" color="green" /> {/* Reuse Button */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
* **Composition:** The `HomePage` combines `Navbar`, `Card`, and `Button`. The `Card` also uses `Button` inside it.
* **Reusability:** The `Button` is used in multiple places with different text and colors. The `Card` is used for different content (meeting and profile).

### Tips for Good Composition and Reusability
* **Keep Components Small:** Like making a door handle instead of a whole door, keep components focused on one job (e.g., a Button just handles clicks, not a whole form).
* **Use Props for Flexibility:** Props are like paint—you can customize a component (e.g., change a Button’s text or color) without rewriting it.
* **Don’t Repeat Yourself:** If you’re copying and pasting code, it’s like carving the same door handle twice. Make a reusable component instead.
* **Think Like a Kampung Builder:** Plan how parts (components) fit together to make the whole village (app) work smoothly.

So, in kampung terms, React’s component composition is like building a house from reusable parts, and reusability is like using the same mold to make those parts for many houses. It’s all about working smart, keeping things tidy, and making your app as welcoming as a kampung community!
