# What’s a Component Design System?
In ReactJS, a component is like a reusable building block for your house. Think of it as a pre-made window, door, or roof tile. Instead of building every window from scratch every time, you create one solid design and reuse it across the house. A design system is like a big blueprint book that contains all these pre-made blocks (components) with clear instructions on how to use them, what they look like, and how they behave.

This blueprint book makes sure everyone in the kampung (your team) builds houses that look consistent and work well together. For example, all windows have the same style, size, and way of opening, so the house doesn’t look like a patchwork mess. In React, a design system might include buttons, forms, or navigation bars that are styled and coded to match the app’s vibe.
# Why Use a Design System?
Imagine every builder in the kampung making their own windows with different shapes and colors. The house would look chaotic, and fixing things would be a nightmare. A design system is like agreeing, “Hey, let’s all use this window design, this color, and this wood type.” It saves time, keeps things neat, and makes it easier to fix or add new parts later.

In React, a design system ensures:
Consistency: All buttons look and feel the same across your app.

**Efficiency:** Developers don’t waste time redesigning the same button.

**Scalability:** New team members can quickly pick up the blueprint and build without confusion.
#What’s Storybook?
Now, let’s talk about Storybook. Think of Storybook as a showroom in the kampung where you display all your building blocks (components) for everyone to see. Instead of showing the whole house, you show each piece—like a window, door, or roof tile—on its own. People can see how each piece looks, try it out, and even play with its settings (like changing the window’s color or size).

In tech terms, Storybook is a tool that lets you build, test, and showcase React components in isolation, outside your main app. It’s like a catalog where you can see every component, its variations, and how it behaves with different inputs.

# How Storybook Fits into a Design System
In the kampung, your blueprint book (design system) lists all the components, but it’s just paper. Storybook is the interactive version of that book. You can:
Showcase components: Display a button in all its forms—big, small, red, blue, disabled, etc.

**Test them:** Try clicking the button or changing its text to see how it behaves.

**Document them:** Add notes like, “Use this button for important actions, not for navigation.”

Share with the team: Everyone, from designers to developers, can visit the Storybook “showroom” online and understand how to use the components.
#How It Works in the Kampung (Code) Sense
Let’s say you’re building a React app for a kampung food stall. You create a Button component in your design system. Here’s how it ties together:
Create the Component:
You code a reusable Button component in React, like:
```jsx
function Button({ label, color }) {
  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>{label}</button>;
}
```
*Add to Storybook:
In Storybook, you create a “story” for this Button. A story is like a page in the showroom catalog showing one version of the component:
```jsx
import { Button } from './Button';

export default {
  title: 'Kampung Components/Button',
  component: Button,
};

export const Primary = () => <Button label="Order Nasi Lemak" color="blue" />;
export const Secondary = () => <Button label="Cancel Order" color="gray" />;
```
This creates a Storybook page where you can see the Button in “Primary” (blue) and “Secondary” (gray) styles.

# Integrate with Design System:
Your design system defines rules, like “Primary buttons are always blue and used for main actions.” Storybook shows these rules in action, so everyone knows how to use the Button correctly.

Use in Your App:
In your food stall app, you import the Button and use it:
```jsx
import { Button } from './components/Button';

function FoodStall() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button label="Order Nasi Lemak" color="blue" />
      <Button label="Cancel Order" color="gray" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
#Team Collaboration:
Designers can check Storybook to see how the Button looks without touching the code. Developers can test it with different settings. Even the kampung auntie (the client) can visit Storybook’s web link to approve the design!
#Why Storybook is Cool for the Kampung
No Need to Run the Whole App: You don’t need to build the entire house to show someone a window. Storybook lets you test components alone.

**Catch Mistakes Early:** If the Button looks weird in red, you’ll spot it in Storybook before it’s in the app.

**Teach New Builders:** New team members can browse Storybook to learn the design system without digging through code.

**Play with Variations:** Want to see how the Button looks on a dark background? Storybook lets you test that easily.
#Real-World Kampung Example
Imagine your kampung is launching a website for all its food stalls. You create a design system with components like:
`Button`: For ordering food.

`Card`: To display each dish (nasi lemak, roti canai, etc.).

`Form`: For customers to input delivery details.
In Storybook, you’d have a page for each component, showing:
Button in different colors (blue for “Order,” red for “Delete”).

Card with different images or prices.

Form with error states (like “Please enter a valid address”).
*The whole team—coders, designers, and even the stall owners—can visit Storybook online to see these components, try them out, and agree on how they should work. When you build the website, everyone’s on the same page, and the site looks like one cohesive kampung, not a jumble of mismatched parts.

### Final Thoughts
A ReactJS component design system is like the kampung’s blueprint book, ensuring every house (or app) looks consistent and works well. Storybook is the interactive showroom where you display and test those blueprints. Together, they make building apps faster, easier, and less chaotic—like building a beautiful kampung where every house fits perfectly together
