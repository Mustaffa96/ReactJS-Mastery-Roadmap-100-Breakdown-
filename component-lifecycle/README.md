Alright, let’s break down ReactJS component lifecycle and the useEffect hook in a way that feels like we’re chatting in a kampung (village) setting, keeping it simple and relatable, like explaining it to a neighbor over some teh tarik at the warung.

# What’s a Component in ReactJS?

Imagine a kampung house. A React component is like one part of the house—maybe the kitchen, the living room, or even the angklung corner where you play music. Each component has its own job (like displaying a button or a form) and lives in your app, working together to make the whole house (your website) function.

But a component isn’t just built and left alone—it has a lifecycle, like a person in the kampung. It’s born, grows, does its work, and sometimes “retires” when it’s no longer needed. The lifecycle is about the stages a component goes through: mounting (being built), updating (getting a makeover), and unmounting (being taken down).

# The Component Lifecycle in Kampung Terms
Let’s say you’re building a warung (small shop) in the kampung. The lifecycle of your warung works like this:
* **Mounting (Building the Warung)**
This is when you first set up the warung. You lay the foundation, put up the walls, and stock the shelves with kuih and drinks. In React, this is when a component is created and added to the screen (the DOM).  
    * Example: You make a “Welcome Sign” component for your app. When the page loads, React “builds” it and puts it on the screen.
* **Updating (Restocking or Repainting the Warung)**
Your warung is open, but sometimes you need to restock the teh tarik or repaint the walls because a customer spilled sambal. In React, this happens when a component’s state or props change, causing it to “update” and show new info.  
  * Example: If your “Welcome Sign” component changes from “Selamat Datang” to “Welcome, Friends!” because someone clicked a button, that’s an update.
* **Unmounting (Closing the Warung)**
One day, you decide to shut down the warung or move it elsewhere. You pack up the shelves and take down the sign. In React, this is when a component is removed from the screen (like when you navigate to a different page).  
  * Example: If the “Welcome Sign” is no longer needed because the user went to another page, React takes it down.

# What’s `useEffect`? (Handling Side Effects in the Kampung)
Now, let’s talk about **useEffect**. In the kampung, not everything you do is just about building or updating the warung. Sometimes, you need to do “extra” things, like calling the supplier to deliver more kopi or checking the weather to decide if you should open the warung today. These “extra” tasks are like side effects in React—things that happen outside the normal flow of building or updating a component.

In React, **side effects** are things like:
* Fetching data from a server (like calling the supplier).
* Setting up a timer (like checking the clock to close the warung).
* Updating the browser’s title (like changing the warung signboard).
* The useEffect hook is your assistant who handles these side tasks for you. It’s like hiring Pakcik Ali to manage those extra jobs so you can focus on running the warung.

# How `useEffect` Works in Kampung Terms
Imagine you tell Pakcik Ali, “Every time we open the warung or restock, call the supplier for more kuih.” You also tell him, “Oh, and when we close the warung, cancel the order.” This is how `useEffect` works—it runs your “side tasks” at specific times in the component’s lifecycle.

Here’s the breakdown:
* **useEffect** is a function you use in a React component to say, “Hey, do this extra task when something happens.”
  * It runs **after the component mounts** (when the warung is built) or **updates** (when you restock or repaint).
  * You can also tell it to “clean up” when the component unmounts (when the warung closes).
Here’s a simple example in code, explained in kampung style:
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function WarungSign() {
  const [stock, setStock] = useState('Kuih');

  // useEffect is like hiring Pakcik Ali to do side tasks
  useEffect(() => {
    // This runs when the warung opens or restocks
    console.log('Calling supplier for more ' + stock);
    
    // Cleanup: Cancel the order when the warung closes
    return () => {
      console.log('Cancel the supplier order for ' + stock);
    };
  }, [stock]); // Only call Pakcik Ali when the stock changes

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Warung Stock: {stock}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setStock('Teh Tarik')}>Change to Teh Tarik</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
# Explaining the Code in Kampung Terms
* **The Component:** The `WarungSign` component is like the signboard of your warung. It shows what’s in stock (like “Kuih” or “Teh Tarik”).
* **State:** The `stock` variable is like what’s currently on your warung shelves. You can change it (e.g., from “Kuih” to “Teh Tarik”) by clicking a button.
* **useEffect:** This is Pakcik Ali’s job. You tell him:
  * “When the warung opens or the stock changes, call the supplier to order more of whatever’s in `stock`.”
  * “When the warung closes or before the stock changes again, cancel the previous order.”
* **Dependency Array (`[stock]`):** This is like telling Pakcik Ali, “Only call the supplier when the stock changes.” If you leave the array empty ([]), he’ll only call when the warung first opens. If you don’t include an array at all, he’ll call every time the warung updates, which might be too much!

# When Does useEffect Run?
* **After Mounting:** When the warung is first built, `useEffect` runs (e.g., Pakcik Ali calls the supplier when the warung opens).
* **After Updating:** If something in the dependency array (like `stock`) changes, `useEffect` runs again (e.g., Pakcik Ali calls for new stock when you switch from kuih to teh tarik).
* **Before Unmounting:** When the warung closes, the cleanup function (the `return` part of `useEffect`) runs to tidy up (e.g., cancel the supplier order).

### Why Use `useEffect`?
Without `useEffect`, your component would try to do these side tasks (like fetching data) while it’s busy building or updating the warung. That’s messy, like trying to cook nasi lemak and call the supplier at the same time. `useEffect` makes sure these tasks happen at the right time, keeping your warung running smoothly.

### A Real-Life Kampung Example
Let’s say your warung has a website that shows how many kuih are left. You want:
* To fetch the kuih stock from a server when the warung opens.
* To update the stock when someone buys kuih.
* To stop checking the stock when the website closes.
Here’s how you’d use `useEffect`:
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function KuihCounter() {
  const [kuihCount, setKuihCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch kuih stock when the warung opens
    fetch('https://api.warung.com/kuih')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setKuihCount(data.count));

    // Cleanup: Stop checking stock when the warung closes
    return () => {
      console.log('Stop checking kuih stock');
    };
  }, []); // Empty array means this only runs when the warung opens

  return <h1>Kuih Left: {kuihCount}</h1>;
}
```
In this case:
* The warung (component) opens, and `useEffect` fetches the kuih stock from the server.
* When the website closes (component unmounts), the cleanup function runs to stop any ongoing tasks.
* The empty dependency array (`[]`) means this only happens when the component mounts, not on every update.

### Tips for Using useEffect in the Kampung
* **Be Specific with Dependencies:** Only put what Pakcik Ali needs to watch (e.g., `[stock]`) in the dependency array. If you forget it, he might call the supplier too often or not at all!
* **Clean Up Properly:** Always include a cleanup function (the `return` part) if your side effect involves timers, subscriptions, or ongoing tasks. It’s like making sure Pakcik Ali cancels old orders before making new ones.
* **Don’t Overdo Side Effects:** Don’t put every task in `useEffect`. It’s for “extra” stuff, not the main job of running the warung (like rendering the UI).
