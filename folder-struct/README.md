# What’s a ReactJS Folder Structure?

Imagine you’re building a kampung house, but not just any house—a big one that can grow as your family expands. You don’t just throw all your furniture, clothes, and kitchen tools into one room, right? You organize them into separate spaces: a kitchen for cooking, bedrooms for sleeping, a living room for guests, and maybe a storeroom for extra stuff. A ReactJS folder structure is like that—it’s how you organize your code files so everything is neat, easy to find, and ready to grow without turning into a messy kampung bazaar.

In React, your app is made of components (like reusable building blocks), and you need a way to arrange these components, styles, and other files so your project doesn’t end up like a pile of kuih scattered on the floor.

# Why Care About Folder Structure?
Think of your React app as a growing kampung. If it’s just a small hut (a simple app), you can keep things basic. But if you’re building a whole kampung with many houses, a surau, and a market (a big app with lots of features), you need a proper plan. A good folder structure:
* **Makes it easy to find stuff** (like knowing exactly where your nasi lemak ingredients are).

* **Helps new people** (like new villagers or developers) understand the kampung layout quickly.

* **Lets you add new features** (like building a new house) without breaking the old ones.

* Keeps the kampung clean and manageable, even when it grows big.
# Basic Folder Structure (The Small Kampung)
For a small React app, your folder structure might look like a simple kampung house. Here’s an example, explained in kampung terms:
```
my-kampung-app/
├── public/                ← The village signboard and public stuff
│   ├── index.html         ← The main entrance to your kampung (the HTML file)
│   └── favicon.ico        ← The kampung logo
├── src/                   ← The heart of the kampung where everyone lives
│   ├── assets/            ← The storage shed for images, fonts, or other stuff
│   ├── components/        ← Reusable tools like windows or doors (shared UI parts)
│   │   ├── Header.js      ← The roof of the house (navigation bar)
│   │   └── Footer.js      ← The floor of the house (bottom section)
│   ├── pages/             ← Different houses in the kampung (main screens)
│   │   ├── Home.js        ← The main living room
│   │   └── About.js       ← The guest room
│   ├── App.js             ← The blueprint of the whole kampung
│   ├── index.js           ← The gatekeeper who starts the app
│   └── styles/            ← The paint and decorations (CSS or SCSS files)
├── package.json           ← The kampung rulebook (lists tools and scripts)
└── README.md              ← The village history book (docs for others)
```
`public/`: Like the kampung’s public square—holds stuff everyone can see, like the main HTML file.

`src/`: The actual kampung where all the action happens—your code lives here.

`components/`: Reusable parts, like making standard windows or doors you can use in many houses.

`pages/`: Each page is like a different house or room in the kampung (e.g., Home, About, Contact).

`styles/`: Where you keep the paint and decorations for your kampung to look nice.

`App.js`: The master plan that ties all the houses and parts together.

`package.json`: The rulebook that lists what tools (like npm packages) your kampung needs.
This works fine for a small app, like a kampung with a few houses. But if your kampung grows into a bustling town with shops, schools, and markets, this simple structure can get messy fast. That’s where scalability and feature-based architecture come in.
# Scaling Up: Feature-Based Architecture (The Big Kampung)
When your React app grows—like a kampung turning into a small town—you need a smarter way to organize things. A feature-based architecture is like dividing your kampung into smaller neighborhoods, where each neighborhood (feature) has everything it needs to work on its own.

Imagine your app has features like a “User Profile,” “Shopping Cart,” and “Chat System.” Instead of mixing all the code together, you create a separate “neighborhood” for each feature. 

Each neighborhood has its own components, styles, logic, and maybe even its own data-fetching code. This keeps things tidy and makes it easier to add new neighborhoods (features) later.
Here’s what a feature-based folder structure might look like:
```
my-kampung-app/
├── public/                ← Still the village signboard
├── src/
│   ├── features/          ← The neighborhoods of the kampung
│   │   ├── Auth/          ← The gatehouse (login, signup, etc.)
│   │   │   ├── components/  ← UI parts for the gatehouse (e.g., LoginForm.js)
│   │   │   ├── api/         ← Tools to talk to the outside world (API calls)
│   │   │   ├── hooks/       ← Special tools for the gatehouse (e.g., useAuth.js)
│   │   │   ├── styles/      ← Paint for the gatehouse (CSS/SCSS)
│   │   │   └── index.js     ← The gatehouse’s main entrance
│   │   ├── Cart/          ← The market (shopping cart feature)
│   │   │   ├── components/  ← UI parts (e.g., CartItem.js)
│   │   │   ├── api/         ← Tools to fetch cart data
│   │   │   ├── hooks/       ← Special market tools (e.g., useCart.js)
│   │   │   ├── styles/      ← Market decorations
│   │   │   └── index.js     ← The market’s main entrance
│   │   └── Chat/          ← The community center (chat feature)
│   │       ├── components/  ← UI parts (e.g., ChatBubble.js)
│   │       ├── api/         ← Tools to fetch messages
│   │       ├── hooks/       ← Special chat tools (e.g., useChat.js)
│   │       ├── styles/      ← Community center decorations
│   │       └── index.js     ← The community center’s main entrance
│   ├── shared/            ← The kampung’s shared toolshed
│   │   ├── components/    ← Reusable parts for all neighborhoods (e.g., Button.js)
│   │   ├── hooks/         ← Reusable tools (e.g., useWindowSize.js)
│   │   └── utils/         ← Common helpers (e.g., formatDate.js)
│   ├── App.js             ← The master plan for the whole town
│   ├── index.js           ← The gatekeeper to start the app
│   └── styles/            ← Global decorations for the whole town
├── package.json           ← The town rulebook
└── README.md              ← The town history book
```
Why Feature-Based Architecture is Scalable
This setup is like turning your kampung into a well-planned town. Here’s why it works for big apps:

# Each Feature is Self-Contained:
Every “neighborhood” (feature) has its own components, styles, and logic. For example, the “Cart” feature has everything it needs to work, so you don’t have to dig through the whole kampung to find its code.

If you want to change the Cart, you only touch the `/features/Cart/` folder. It’s like fixing one house without disturbing the others.
Easy to Add New Features:
Want to add a “Payment” feature? Just create a new `/features/Payment/` folder with its own components, styles, and logic. It’s like building a new house in the kampung without messing up the existing ones.
*Team-Friendly:
If you have a team of developers (like villagers working together), each person can work on a different feature (neighborhood) without stepping on each other’s toes. One team works on the “Chat” feature, another on the “Auth” feature, and so on.
*Less Mess, More Clarity:
Instead of having 100 components in one /components/ folder, they’re split into feature folders. It’s like knowing exactly which house to go to for nasi lemak instead of searching the whole kampung.
*Easier Testing and Debugging:
Since each feature is independent, you can test the “Cart” feature without worrying about the “Chat” feature. It’s like checking if one house’s electricity works without touching the others.
*Reusable Shared Code:
The `/shared/` folder is like the kampung’s community shed—things like reusable buttons, hooks, or utility functions go here, so every feature can use them.
Tips for Keeping Your Kampung Scalable
To make sure your React kampung stays ready to grow:
Keep Features Independent: Don’t let the “Cart” feature depend too much on the “Chat” feature. Each should work on its own, like separate houses.

**Use Good Naming**: Name your folders and files clearly, like “CartItem.js” instead of “Item.js”. It’s like labeling your kampung houses so nobody gets lost.

**Centralize Shared Logic**: Put reusable code in the /shared/ folder to avoid repeating yourself, like sharing a water pump among houses.

**Use State Management Wisely**: For big apps, use tools like Redux or Zustand to manage data across features, like a kampung council that coordinates between houses.

**Modularize Styles**: Use CSS modules or styled-components to keep styles tied to specific features, so the “Cart” styles don’t mess with the “Chat” styles.

**Automate with Tools**: Use tools like ESLint or Prettier to keep your code clean, like sweeping the kampung regularly to avoid clutter.
#Real-World Example
Imagine you’re building a kampung app like an e-commerce site. You might have:
Auth Feature: Handles login and signup, with its own forms, API calls, and styles.

**Cart Feature:** Manages the shopping cart, with components like CartItem and hooks like useCart.

**Product Feature:** Shows product listings and details, with its own API calls and styles.
*Each feature lives in its own folder, so when your boss says, “Add a Wishlist feature,” you just create /features/Wishlist/ and start building, without touching the rest of the kampung.

### Wrapping Up
A good React folder structure is like planning a kampung that can grow from a small village to a big town. Start with a simple structure for small apps, but as your app grows, switch to a feature-based architecture to keep things organized, independent, and easy to scale. Each feature is like a self-sufficient neighborhood with its own tools, and the `/shared/` folder is the community shed everyone can use. This way, your kampung stays neat, welcoming, and ready for new houses—no matter how big it gets!
