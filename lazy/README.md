Alright, let’s break down ReactJS Lazy Loading with React.lazy and Suspense in a simple, "kampung" way—like we’re chatting at a warung kopi, okay?

# What’s Lazy Loading?

Imagine you go to a mamak stall with a super long menu—nasi lemak, roti canai, teh tarik, everything lah. But instead of the chef cooking all the dishes at once (which takes forever and clogs the kitchen), they only cook what you order when you order it. That’s lazy loading—only loading the stuff you need, when you need it.

In ReactJS, lazy loading means you don’t load all your app’s components (like heavy images, big code files, or whole pages) when the app starts. Instead, you load them only when the user needs them, like when they click to a new page. This makes your app faster, especially for big apps, because you’re not wasting time loading things nobody’s using yet.

# What’s `React.lazy`?
`React.lazy` is like telling your app, “Oi, don’t bother loading this component now lah. Wait until I ask for it.” It’s a way to split your code into smaller chunks and load them only when needed.
For example, say you have a page for “User Profile” and another for “Photo Gallery.” Instead of loading both at the start, you use React.lazy to load the “Photo Gallery” code only when someone clicks to see it.

# What’s `Suspense`?
Now, when you’re lazy loading, there’s a tiny delay while the app fetches that component, right? Like waiting for your roti canai to come out from the kitchen. Suspense is like a friendly waiter who says, “Hang on, food’s coming, here’s a ‘Loading’ sign to keep you calm.” It shows a fallback (like a spinning loader or “Tunggu jap…”) while the component is loading.

# How It Works in “Kampung” Code Terms
Let’s say you’re building a React app for a kampung food delivery service. You got a Home page and a Menu page, but the Menu page is heavy because it has lots of food pictures.

### Step 1: Use `React.lazy`
You tell React to load the Menu page only when someone wants to see it:
```javascript
import React, { lazy } from 'react';

// Instead of importing the Menu component directly
// const Menu = import('./Menu');
const Menu = lazy(() => import('./Menu')); // Lazy load, only fetch when needed
```
This is like saying, “Don’t prepare the Menu page yet. Wait until customer clicks ‘Menu’ lah.”

### Step 2: Wrap with `Suspense`
Since the Menu page might take a second to load, you wrap it with Suspense to show a “Loading” message:
```javascript
import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import Home from './Home';
const Menu = lazy(() => import('./Menu'));

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Home />
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Tunggu jap, loading menu...</div>}>
        <Menu />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
Here, `<Suspense>` is like the waiter holding up a “Sabar, menu tengah load” sign while the Menu page fetches. The fallback is what users see during the wait.

### Step 3: Add Routes (Optional)
If you’re `using react-router-dom` for navigation (like Home page vs. Menu page), it looks like this:
```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
const Menu = lazy(() => import('./Menu'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Tunggu jap, loading...</div>}>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
          <Route path="/menu" component={Menu} />
        </Switch>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```
This way, the Menu page only loads when someone goes to /menu. If they stay on the Home page, no need to waste bandwidth loading Menu.

### Why Bother with Lazy Loading?
* **Faster app:** Like serving teh tarik first instead of cooking the whole menu. Your app starts faster because it loads less stuff upfront.
* **Save data:** Especially for kampung folks with slow Wi-Fi or limited data, you’re not forcing them to download everything at once.
* **Better experience:** Users don’t wait forever for the app to load, especially on mobile.

### Things to Watch Out For
* **Internet mati:** If the user’s connection is bad, the lazy-loaded component might take longer. Make sure your fallback looks nice and reassuring.
* **Code splitting:** Lazy loading works best with tools like Webpack (which React apps usually have). It splits your code into smaller files automatically.
* **Suspense only for lazy**: Right now, Suspense is mainly for lazy loading components. Don’t expect it to handle other async stuff like API calls (yet).

### Real-Life Kampung Example
Imagine your app is like a pasar malam stall. You don’t bring all your goods to the stall at once—too heavy lah. Instead, you keep some in the van and only bring them out when customers ask. React.lazy is like keeping the extra goods in the van, and Suspense is your assistant saying, “Tunggu, I go grab from the van first.”

### Summary
* **Lazy loading:** Load only what you need, when you need it, to make your app fast.
* `React.lazy`: Tells React to fetch a component only when it’s needed.
* **Suspense: Shows a “Loading” message while waiting for the component to arrive.
* **It’s like running a smart mamak stall—don’t cook everything at once, serve what’s ordered, and keep customers happy with a “Sabar, tengah masak” sign.
