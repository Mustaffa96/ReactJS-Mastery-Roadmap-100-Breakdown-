Alright, let’s explain Redux (and Redux Toolkit) for global state management in ReactJS using simple, kampung (village) terms, as if we’re sitting under a coconut tree chatting with a cup of teh tarik. Imagine we’re running a busy kampung market, and we need to keep everything organized so everyone knows what’s going on.

# What is Redux, and Why Do We Need It?
In a kampung market, you’ve got many stalls—vegetable stall, fish stall, nasi lemak stall, and so on. Each stall has its own stuff to manage (like how many tomatoes or fish are left). But sometimes, the whole market needs to know something important, like “the market is closing early today” or “we’re out of coconuts for the cendol stall.” Instead of every stall shouting their own updates and causing chaos, you need one central ketua kampung (village chief) to keep track of all the important info and share it with everyone.

**Redux** is like that ketua kampung. It’s a way to manage the “global state” (important shared info) of your ReactJS app, so all parts of the app (like components or “stalls”) can access and update the same info without confusion.

# How Does Redux Work (In Kampung Terms)?
Imagine the market has a big blackboard at the center where the ketua kampung writes down all the important updates for everyone to see. This blackboard is the Redux Store, the single place where all the shared info (state) is kept.

Here’s how it works in the kampung market:
* **The Blackboard (Store):** This is where all the important info is written, like “10 coconuts left” or “market closes at 5 PM.” In Redux, the store holds the entire state of your app in one place.

* **The Rules (Reducers):** The ketua kampung has strict rules about how to update the blackboard. For example, if the fish stall sells 5 fish, the ketua updates the blackboard by subtracting 5 from the total fish count. In Redux, reducers are functions that decide how the state changes based on specific actions.

* **The Messengers (Actions):** When something happens (like selling fish), the stall sends a messenger to the ketua kampung with a note saying, “Sold 5 fish!” This note is an action in Redux—a simple message that describes what happened.

* **The Stalls (Components):** Each stall in the market (like your React components) can check the blackboard to see the latest info or send a messenger to update it. They don’t mess with the blackboard directly; they rely on the ketua kampung to keep things organized.

So, Redux makes sure everyone in the kampung market is on the same page by having one central blackboard (store), clear rules for updating it (reducers), and messengers to report changes (actions).

# What’s Redux Toolkit? The Modern Kampung Upgrade
Now, running the market with just Redux can sometimes feel like a lot of work. The ketua kampung has to write a lot of notes, follow strict rules, and sometimes things get messy with too much paperwork. Redux Toolkit is like giving the ketua kampung a shiny new smartphone to manage the market more easily.

**Redux Toolkit** simplifies Redux by providing tools to make the process faster and less confusing:
* **Easier Rules (createSlice):** Instead of writing long, complicated rules for updating the blackboard, Redux Toolkit’s createSlice lets you write simpler rules. It’s like giving the ketua a template to quickly jot down updates.

* **Less Paperwork (Built-in Middleware):** Redux Toolkit comes with pre-set helpers (like middleware for handling async tasks) so you don’t have to set up everything from scratch. It’s like the ketua getting an assistant to handle deliveries or messages.

* **Ready-to-Use Tools (configureStore):** Setting up the blackboard (store) is easier with Redux Toolkit’s configureStore, which handles a lot of the setup automatically, so the ketua can focus on managing the market.

In short, Redux Toolkit is the modern, easier way to run your kampung market, reducing the hassle of managing the state while still keeping everything organized.

# How Does This Look in a ReactJS App?
Let’s bring it back to ReactJS, but still in kampung style. Imagine your React app is the kampung market, and each component (like a button, form, or display) is a stall. Without Redux, each stall might try to keep track of its own info, and if the nasi lemak stall needs to know how many coconuts the cendol stall has, they’d have to shout across the market, causing confusion.

With **Redux (or Redux Toolkit):**
* You create a **store** (the blackboard) to hold all the shared info, like the number of coconuts or the user’s login status.

* You define **actions** (messenger notes) like “ADD_COCONUT” or “SELL_FISH” to describe what’s happening.

* You write **reducers** (or use `createSlice` in Redux Toolkit) to update the store based on those actions. For example, “ADD_COCONUT” increases the coconut count by 1.

* Your React components (stalls) connect to the store using hooks like `useSelector` (to read the blackboard) and `useDispatch` (to send a messenger with an action).

For example:
* The nasi lemak stall (a component) checks the store to see how many coconuts are left (useSelector).

* If it uses a coconut, it sends an action saying “USE_COCONUT” (useDispatch), and the store updates the count for everyone to see.

# Why Use Redux or Redux Toolkit in a Kampung App?
* **No Chaos:** Without a central blackboard, stalls would keep their own notes, leading to confusion (like one stall thinking there are 10 coconuts while another thinks there are 5). Redux ensures one source of truth.

* **Easy Sharing:** All stalls (components) can access the same info, like whether the market is open or how many fish are left, without passing notes back and forth.

* **Predictable Updates:** The ketua kampung (Redux) makes sure updates follow clear rules, so there’s no accidental mess-up.

* **Scales Well:** If your kampung market grows to 100 stalls, Redux keeps things manageable, unlike shouting between stalls, which gets messy fast.

# A Simple Code Example (Using Redux Toolkit)
Here’s how the kampung market might look in code with Redux Toolkit:
```javascript

// 1. Create a slice (like the ketua kampung's rules for the blackboard)
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const marketSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'market',
  initialState: { coconuts: 10 }, // Starting with 10 coconuts
  reducers: {
    addCoconut(state) {
      state.coconuts += 1; // Add 1 coconut
    },
    useCoconut(state) {
      state.coconuts -= 1; // Use 1 coconut
    },
  },
});

// Export actions (messenger notes)
export const { addCoconut, useCoconut } = marketSlice.actions;

// 2. Create the store (the blackboard)
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    market: marketSlice.reducer,
  },
});

// 3. Use in a React component (a stall)
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

function NasiLemakStall() {
  const coconuts = useSelector((state) => state.market.coconuts); // Read the blackboard
  const dispatch = useDispatch(); // Send a messenger

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Coconuts left: {coconuts}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(useCoconut())}>Use a coconut</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
### When to Use Redux or Redux Toolkit?
Use Redux (or better, Redux Toolkit) when your kampung market (React app) gets big, with many stalls (components) that need to share and update info. If it’s just a small warung (shop) with one or two components, simpler solutions like React’s useState or useContext might be enough.

**Redux Toolkit** is the way to go in 2025 because it’s easier to set up and use than plain Redux. It’s like upgrading from a manual blackboard to a digital one with less hassle.
### Final Kampung Wisdom
Think of Redux as the ketua kampung who keeps the market running smoothly with one central blackboard (store), clear rules (reducers), and messengers (actions). Redux Toolkit is the same ketua with a smartphone, making everything faster and less stressful. It’s perfect for keeping your React app’s state organized, especially when the kampung gets busy!
